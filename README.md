# Welcome!
# This is AniDex. An unofficial MyAnimeList API-based app.
 AniDex was made as a university project, while being my biggest passion work up to date as a young android developer.
 It provides a comparatively quick and hopefully convenient access to the MyAnimeList database.
 Its current functionality is like one of a MovieDB app: watching tops, trailers and short summaries of both anime and manga titles.
